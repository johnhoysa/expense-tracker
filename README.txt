A simple project I was assigned for a skills assessment. 

Create a simple expense tracking application. Follow the mockup provided above to get some idea. Basic features are:

There will be a single user. This is a frontend-only project. No DB or multi user involved
User can add income and expenses
Ability to see each income/expense record separately
Each record would contain the description, amount, date and Delete button
Clicking Delete will remove the record and update calculation
Show Balance at the top (Balance = Income - Expense)
The total amount for both income and expense section should be shown

Notes on time:
    1 hour for basic html structure and css names
    1 hour JS for basics of showing content
    45 minutes - get total distracted as well
    2 hour distracted
    1 hour JS clean up
    1 hour design to page
    45 minutes CSS clean up
    
    total time 7.5 hours

    To do next: 
        Convert to TypeScript
